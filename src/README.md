## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Activity, teacher, and announcement data are stored in MongoDB. The sample seed data is inserted automatically when the collections are empty.

## Announcement Rules

- Announcements are database-driven and displayed from the active record in MongoDB.
- Start dates are optional.
- Expiration dates are required.
- Only signed-in users can open the announcement manager and edit records.
